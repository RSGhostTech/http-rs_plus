## Why not http crate?

**http crate is a good crate to use. 
But fewer things to do**

*People do not like many crates to use.*

Send a http request,you normally use reqwest crate to send a http request

Build a server service,you normally to make a service

You also need an async/await runtime and more...

**HTTP is easy,but too many crates make it difficult**

**An HTTP crate do not need too many crates**
